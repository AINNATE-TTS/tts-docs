description: Receive notifications from your TTS API requests in real-time with webhooks.
---

TTS OpenAI can send HTTP POST requests to your server when a TTS API request is completed. This feature is called webhooks. Webhooks are a powerful way to receive real-time updates on the status of your TTS API requests. You can download the audio file, check the status of the request, and more.

You can test webhooks using a service like [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/).

## Webhook Setup

### Register Webhook URL

To receive the notifications, you need to setup a webhook URL in your [Service Integration](https://ttsopenai.com/profile/integration/Æ°ebhook) settings. The URL should be accessible from the internet and respond to POST requests. Each notification event will have one `event` field which can be used by your server to identify the type of event.

When your application receives a webhook notification, it should respond with a `200 OK` status code. If your server does not respond with a `200 OK` status code, TTS OpenAI will retry sending the notification for up to 3 times, with a delay of 1 hour between each retry.


### Verify Signature

With the security concerns, it is highly recommended that clients verify the authenticity of the webhook requests by validating the `x-signature` header. The `x-signature` header is a HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request body signed with our private key. 

Here is an example of how to verify the signature:

1. Download the public key from here: [Public Key](https://docs.ttsopenai.com/assets/uapi_public_key.pem)

2. Use the following code to verify the signature:

::code-group

```ts [py]
def verify_signature_by_public_key(data: str, signature: bytes, public_key_path: str) -> bool:
    try:
        # Load your public key
        with open(public_key_path, "rb") as key_file:
            public_key = load_pem_public_key(key_file.read())

        # Create MD5 hash of the data
        event_data_hash = md5(data.encode()).digest()
        print(event_data_hash.hex())
        # Verify the signature
        public_key.verify(
            signature,
            event_data_hash,
            padding.PKCS1v15(),
            hashes.SHA256()
        )
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
        return False

result = verify_signature_by_public_key(event_uuid, bytes.fromhex(signature), "path/to/public/key/public_key.pem")
```

```ts [ts]
import { createHash, createVerify } from 'crypto'
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'

function verifySignatureByPublicKey(data: string, signature: string, publicKeyPath: string): boolean {
  try {
    // Load your public key
    const publicKey = readFileSync(publicKeyPath, 'utf8')

    // Create MD5 hash of the data
    const eventDataHash = createHash('md5').update(data).digest('hex')

    // Verify the signature
    const verifier = createVerify('RSA-SHA256')
    verifier.update(eventDataHash)
    return verifier.verify(publicKey, Buffer.from(signature, 'hex'))
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e)
    return false
  }
}
```

::

If the signature is valid, the function will return `true`, otherwise it will return `false`. If the signature is invalid, you should not process the webhook request.

We are not responsible for any data loss or security issues if you process the webhook request without verifying the signature.

## Webhook Payload

The webhook payload is sent as a JSON object in the body of the POST request. The payload will contain the following fields:

- `event`: The type of event
- `uuid`: The unique identifier of the event
- `data`: The object containing the details of the TTS Text API request
  - `uuid`: The unique identifier of the TTS Text API request
  - `media_url`: The URL to download the audio file
  - `tts_input`: The text that was converted to speech
  - `voice_id`: The voice used for the conversion
  - `speed`: The speed of the speech
  - `status`: The status of the conversion
  - `model`: The model used for the conversion
  - `used_credit`: The number of credits used for the conversion
  - `speaker_name`: The name of the voice
  - `error_message`: The error message if the conversion failed
  - `status_percentage`: The percentage of the conversion completed
  - `created_at`: The date and time when the request was created
  - `updated_at`: The date and time when the request was updated

## Webhook Events

Events related to the TTS API requests are sent as JSON payloads in the body of the POST request. 

### TTS Text Success

This event is sent when the TTS Text API request is successfully completed. The `event` field will be `TTS_TEXT_SUCCESS`.

### TTS Text Failure

This event is sent when the TTS Text API request fails. The `event` field will be `TTS_TEXT_FAILED`.

### TTS Document Success

This event is sent when the TTS Document API request is successfully completed. The `event` field will be `TTS_DOCUMENT_SUCCESS`.

### TTS Document Failure

This event is sent when the TTS Document API request fails. The `event` field will be `TTS_DOCUMENT_FAILED`.
