## API keys

The Text To Speech OpenAI (TTS) API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can create and manage your API keys in the [Service Intergration](https://ttsopenai.com/profile/integration/api-keys).

Remember that your API key is a secret, and you should never share it in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on. If you believe your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate it at any time. Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an `x-api-key` header. HTTP header as follows:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
