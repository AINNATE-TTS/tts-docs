description: What happens when things go wrong? Learn how to handle errors and troubleshoot issues with the TTS API.
---

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when things go wrong with the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API and how you can handle errors and troubleshoot issues.
Mistakes happen, and mostly they are due to incorrect input data, network issues, or server problems. We will cover the common error codes and how to resolve them.

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging (before contacting support).
